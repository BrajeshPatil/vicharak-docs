Available Boot Modes
====================

Vaaman SBC is pre-installed with **Debian 11** (``Bullseye``) on its eMMC
storage and supports multiple boot modes, including ``SD-card`` and ``NVMe``.
If users wants to run different operating systems, they need to use the
corresponding firmware to program the board.

``NVMe`` has the highest priority, followed by ``SD-card`` and ``eMMC``.
So, if you have an NVMe drive connected to Vaaman SBC, it will first try to
boot from the ``NVMe drive``.
If there is no ``NVMe drive`` connected, it will boot from the ``SD-card``.
If there is no ``SD-card`` inserted, it will boot from the ``eMMC``.

For this guide, we will be using the pre-installed Debian 11 (``Bullseye``) on
the eMMC storage. So, we will not be covering the ``NVMe`` and ``SD-card`` boot
here.

**If you want to boot from NVMe or SD-card.**

Vaaman Boot modes
=================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Boot Mode**
     - **Description**
   * - Normal Mode
     - Normal boot mode is the default boot mode. In this mode, the board boots
       from the `eMMC` or `SD-card`. Each partition loads in order and enters
       the system normally.
   * - Loader Mode
     - Loader mode is used to upgrade the `bootloader`. In this mode, the
       bootloader will wait for the host command for `firmware upgrade`.
       On success, the board boots from the `eMMC` or `SD-card`,
       and the board enters the system normally.
   * - Maskrom Mode
     - | Maskrom mode is used to `repair` the board. In a situation where the
         bootloader is damaged, the board can enter the maskrom mode.
         In general, there is no need to enter `Maskrom` mode.
         In this mode, the bootrom code waits for the host to transmit the
         bootloader code through the USB-C port, load and run it.
