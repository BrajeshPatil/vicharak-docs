You can use the Raspberry Pi Camera Module ``v1`` and ``v2`` with the
Vicharak Vaaman. The ``raspi`` camera module is a small circuit board
that connects to the CSI connector on the Vaaman and allows you to take
photos and videos.

We do not build or design the camera module, but we do test it for
compatibility with our Vaaman. We recommend buying the original camera
module from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, or from one of our authorized
resellers.

You can find more information about the camera module on the `Raspberry
Pi Camera documentation
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html>`_.
